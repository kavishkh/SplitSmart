# Payment System

This document explains the newly implemented payment system in the SplitSmart application, which provides comprehensive views of all expenses and settlements.

## Overview

The payment system now includes three main views:
1. **Expenses Page** - Shows all expenses created by users
2. **Settlements Page** - Shows all payments between users
3. **Payments Page** - Combined view showing both expenses and settlements

## Features

### Expenses Page (`/expenses`)
- Lists all expenses created by users across all groups
- Shows expense details including description, amount, category, and creator
- Includes filtering and search capabilities
- Navigation to Settlements and Payments pages

### Settlements Page (`/settlements`)
- Lists all payments made between users
- Shows payment details including sender, recipient, amount, and confirmation status
- Displays payment descriptions and group information
- Includes filtering by status (confirmed/pending) and other criteria

### Payments Page (`/payments`)
- Combined view showing both expenses and settlements
- Tab-based navigation to switch between views
- Unified filtering system for all payment types
- Comprehensive statistics showing total expenses and payments

## Data Structure

### Expense Object
```typescript
interface Expense {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  amount: number;
  category: string;
  groupId: string;
  paidBy: string;        // User ID of expense creator
  splitBetween: string[]; // Array of user IDs
  date: Date;
  createdBy: string;
  settled: boolean;
}
```

### Settlement Object
```typescript
interface Settlement {
  id: string;
  groupId: string;
  groupName: string;
  fromMember: string;    // User ID of payer
  fromMemberName: string;
  toMember: string;      // User ID of recipient
  toMemberName: string;
  amount: number;
  date: Date;
  confirmed: boolean;
  description?: string;
}
```

## User Experience

### Navigation
- Users can navigate between views using buttons in the header
- Tab-based navigation in the Payments page
- Back buttons to return to previous views

### Filtering
- All pages include comprehensive filtering options
- Filters include:
  - Date range (today, week, month, all time)
  - Amount range (low, medium, high)
  - Group selection
  - Status (for settlements: confirmed/pending)
  - Category (for expenses)

### Search
- All pages include search functionality
- Search works across all text fields (descriptions, names, groups)

### Statistics
- Summary cards showing:
  - Total expenses/payments
  - Confirmed/pending payments
  - Count of transactions

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**
   - Users only see payments relevant to their groups
   - Personal information is protected
   - Group membership controls data visibility

2. **Data Integrity**
   - All payments are linked to specific groups
   - Payment history is maintained for auditing
   - Duplicate payments are prevented

## Integration with Existing Features

### Expense Tracking
- No changes to expense creation or editing workflows
- Existing expense display enhanced with additional navigation

### Group Management
- No changes to group creation or member management
- Payment views work within existing group structures

### Settlement System

- New views provide better organization of payment data

## Future Enhancements

   - Automated reminders for unpaid expenses
   - Notification system for payment requests

2. **Payment Methods**
   - Integration with actual payment processors
   - Multiple payment method options

3. **Analytics**

   - Payment history reports
   - Group spending trends

4. **Mobile Features**
   - Push notifications for payments
   - Quick payment actions

üìã SUPABASE RLS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

To fix the RLS security warnings, you need to enable Row Level Security on your tables.

RUN THE FOLLOWING SQL COMMANDS IN YOUR SUPABASE SQL EDITOR:

-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.groups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.expenses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.settlements ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist (ignore errors if they don't exist)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on groups" ON public.groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on expenses" ON public.expenses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on settlements" ON public.settlements;

-- Create permissive policies for development
-- WARNING: These policies are NOT secure for production use!

-- Permissive policies for users table
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on users" ON public.users
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Permissive policies for groups table
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on groups" ON public.groups
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Permissive policies for expenses table
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on expenses" ON public.expenses
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Permissive policies for settlements table
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on settlements" ON public.settlements
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON public.users TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.groups TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.expenses TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.settlements TO authenticated;

üìù FOR PRODUCTION USE:
When deploying to production, replace the permissive policies with restrictive ones
based on your application's security requirements.

üîó SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
1. Always enable RLS on tables that store user data
2. Create specific policies that limit data access based on user identity
3. Regularly review and audit your RLS policies
4. Use authenticated roles for user-specific data access

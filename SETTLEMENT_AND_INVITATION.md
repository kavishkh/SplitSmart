### API Routes

The settlement system uses the existing API endpoints:
- `POST /api/settlements` - Create new settlements
- `PATCH /api/settlements/:id/confirm` - Confirm settlements
- `GET /api/settlements` - Fetch all settlements
- `GET /api/settlements/group/:groupId` - Fetch group-specific settlements

## Security Considerations

1. **Invitation Links**
   - Links are group-specific and cannot be forged
   - Existing members cannot rejoin groups they're already part of
   - Links don't contain sensitive information

2. **Settlement Confirmations**
   - Only involved parties can confirm settlements
   - All settlement actions are logged
   - Data is validated both client-side and server-side

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Integration**
   - Implement actual email sending for invitations
   - Add email templates for settlement notifications

2. **QR Code Support**
   - Generate QR codes for easy mobile sharing
   - Scanner functionality for joining groups

3. **Advanced Settlement Features**
   - Multi-party settlements
   - Recurring settlement schedules
   - Payment tracking integration

4. **Notification System**
   - Real-time notifications for new invitations
   - Settlement request alerts
   - Confirmation acknowledgments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Group not found" when joining**
   - Verify the invitation link is correct
   - Check that the group still exists
   - Ensure you're logged in with the correct account

2. **Unable to confirm settlements**
   - Verify you're logged in as the correct user
   - Check that the settlement exists

   - Verify the email address is correct
   - Confirm the email sending service is properly configured

### Debugging Tips
